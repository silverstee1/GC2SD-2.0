# GC2SD-2.0
GC2SD 2.0 Upgrade PCB

Replacement upgrade PCB for GC2SD to V2.0 for use on GameCube's Front Memcard Slot B

Based on the SD2SP2 2.0 made by Extrems, Thank you for your hard work!

**Important**

When using the adapter make sure to have the Latest Version of Swiss, Due to the way Swiss handles it in SLOT A it 
acts like a normal speed Passive SDGecko, in SLOT B it works in Semi-Passive 2.0 enhanced speed mode.
